       The Scream
  </h1>
   <p>
    The Scream is a composition created by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch in 1893. The Norwegian name of the piece is
                 Skrik (Scream), and the German title under which it was first exhibited is Der Schrei der Natur (The Scream of
                 Nature). The agonized face in the painting has become one of the most iconic images in art, seen as symbolizing the
                 anxiety of the human condition. Munch's work, including The Scream, had a formative influence on the Expressionist
                 movement.
                 Munch recalled that he had been out for a walk at sunset when suddenly the setting sun's light turned the clouds
                 "a blood red". He sensed an "infinite scream passing through nature". Scholars have located the spot to a
                 fjord overlooking Oslo and have suggested other explanations for the unnaturally orange sky,
                 ranging from the effects of a volcanic eruption to a psychological reaction by Munch to his sister's commitment
                 at a nearby lunatic asylum.
